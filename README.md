# inwasm building blocks

This repo is a collection of certain micro libraries implemented in webassembly and bundled with `inwasm`. The libraries are meant to be used directly via subpackage imports (TODO). The source code can also be used to build bigger single wasm integrations (more tedious atm, as we have no relocation abstraction yet...)

### subpackages
- [base64 decoder](base64decoder/)



### TODO
- github CI integration
- subpackage releases (UMD + ESM)
